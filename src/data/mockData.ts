      "Born in China, my path took me across continents, from Australia to London, UK to McGill University in Montreal. Little did I know that beyond the threshold of graduation lay my darkest chapter - a period of relentless job rejections that echoed with the deafening silence of despair and solitude.",
      "Eventually, securing a role as a logistics and executive assistant ignited a spark of hope, serving as the cornerstone of my career. Evolving within the supply chain arena, each decision propelled me forward, culminating in my current role as Senior manager overseeing imports and transport operations.",
      "<strong>Embracing the challenges, I've emerged stronger, believing that adversity breeds resilience.</strong> Beyond the corporate realm, community volunteering has been my solace, sparking vision to create a supportive community for those enduring similar struggles."

      "After over 15 years in China's supply chain management, moving to Canada in 2017 presented unexpected challenges. Lacking local experience and education, I felt helpless and struggled to restart my career. Through determination and reeducation, I've worked as an Import & Export Specialist in Canada for over 4 years, earning CPIM and CSCP certifications, and transitioning to a supply planning role.",
      "<strong>This personal journey highlighted the struggles that many new immigrants face despite their excellent backgrounds.</strong> They possess valuable skills and experience that could greatly benefit local companies, but often lack the support to navigate the Canadian industry. This realization inspired me to co-found this organization, aiming to empower those facing similar struggles by providing support on career paths, reeducation, networking, skill learning, and experience sharing. I want to help them find a better life in Canada, just as I did."

            "<h2>üõ¨ A Hasty Choice After Arrival</h2>",
            "<p>When Michelle asked me if I could share my job-hunting journey, I agreed without hesitation‚Äîjust like how she had helped recommend me for a job without hesitation when I needed it the most.</p>",
            "<p>Six years ago, shortly after landing in Montreal, I chose to study <strong>Early Childhood Education</strong> at Vanier College. Perhaps because of my teaching background, I assumed it would be easy to transition into another field of education. Without doing much research, I made a hasty decision‚Äîonly to learn that Vanier‚Äôs early childhood education program is among the most challenging to graduate from.</p>",
            "<p>Thankfully, I managed to complete the program on time without missing a single day, but it still took me nearly two years. After graduation, I quickly found work at a daycare, but unfortunately, COVID hit just a month into the job. After two weeks of isolation, I declined the offer to return. COVID was just part of the reason‚Äîthe truth was, I realized I really didn‚Äôt enjoy the work at all.</p>",
            "<h2>üîÅ A Twisting Path to Career Change</h2>",
            "<p>While staying at home, a friend who had arrived in Canada around the same time encouraged me to switch to the <strong>logistics field</strong>. She had studied logistics while I studied early childhood education‚Äîmy program took two years; hers took four months. By the time I was still interning, she was already switching jobs and getting salary bumps. She had hit the ground running.</p>",
            "<p>That‚Äôs when I began to seriously reflect on my career choice. How could such a vast employment gap exist between two programs with such different time investments?</p>",
            "<blockquote>Who says only men fear choosing the wrong career path? Let me tell you‚Äîwomen do too.</blockquote>",
            "<p>Fortunately, Canada has a strong <strong>continuing education system</strong>. It provides a real opportunity for immigrants to pivot professionally. I decided to study <strong>Transportation & Logistics</strong> at Champlain College. Luckily, I got into an <strong>intensive 4-month program</strong> (which no longer exists today). The instructors were very committed to helping us find jobs after graduation‚Äîbut I made another mistake: I decided not to job hunt immediately.</p>",
            "<p>By late 2022, about 7‚Äì8 months after graduation, I started applying for jobs online. But I had missed the ‚Äúgraduation hiring season.‚Äù My instructors had moved on, classmates were already settled, and job leads were few and far between. My applications went unanswered, and I started to feel increasingly discouraged‚Äîalmost hopeless.</p>",
            "<h2>üåà A Beautiful Encounter That Changed Everything</h2>",
            "<p>Just when I felt stuck, a classmate casually said, ‚ÄúLet me add you to this Chinese supply chain group. You might find job leads there.‚Äù That‚Äôs how I joined the group and very quickly received a warm welcome from Michelle, the group leader.</p>",
            "<p>Upon hearing about my urgent job search and struggles, Michelle went out of her way to help. She not only comforted me but actively looked for job leads and passed one along shortly afterward. She also helped me revise my r√©sum√©, reviewed international trade processes and key knowledge with me, encouraged me constantly, and most importantly‚Äî<strong>gave me back my confidence</strong>.</p>",
            "<blockquote>Michelle not only comforted me but actively looked for job leads, helped revise my r√©sum√©, reviewed trade processes, and restored my confidence ‚Äî it was like rain in a drought.</blockquote>",
            "<p>All of this was a timely and selfless gift. I was deeply moved. <em>It really means a lot to me!</em></p>",
            "<p>Thanks to Michelle‚Äôs full support, I landed the job. Seven months later, a recruiter reached out to me, and now I‚Äôm in a position I really enjoy. The company culture is relaxed, my colleagues are friendly and respectful, and I feel truly satisfied.</p>",
            "<h2>ü§ù The Power of Community</h2>",
            "<p>I met Michelle in person at one of the events, she is a warm-hearted and elegant woman with strong organizational and leadership skills. Calling her ‚Äúbeautiful and kind, capable and compassionate‚Äù is no exaggeration.</p>",
            "<p>I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to have met her when I needed help the most. She told me that, as a newcomer herself, she and two friends built this platform out of passion and vision‚Äîto support immigrants in growing their careers within Canada‚Äôs supply chain industry.</p>",
            "<p>There‚Äôs a saying: <em>‚ÄúAt home, rely on your parents; outside, rely on your friends.‚Äù</em> It may sound clich√©, but for us first-generation immigrants, it‚Äôs very real.</p>",
            "<p>In a new land where we lack networks, information, and resources, this platform plays the role of a friend. Even though many members haven‚Äôt met face-to-face, this group has provided useful information and resources. It transformed scattered leads into a <strong>flowing network of opportunity</strong>.</p>",
            "<h2>üôè Grateful for the Encounter</h2>",
