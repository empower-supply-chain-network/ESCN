      "Born in China, my path took me across continents, from Australia to London, UK to McGill University in Montreal. Little did I know that beyond the threshold of graduation lay my darkest chapter - a period of relentless job rejections that echoed with the deafening silence of despair and solitude.",
      "Eventually, securing a role as a logistics and executive assistant ignited a spark of hope, serving as the cornerstone of my career. Evolving within the supply chain arena, each decision propelled me forward, culminating in my current role as Senior manager overseeing imports and transport operations.",
      "<strong>Embracing the challenges, I've emerged stronger, believing that adversity breeds resilience.</strong> Beyond the corporate realm, community volunteering has been my solace, sparking vision to create a supportive community for those enduring similar struggles."

    story: [
      "After over 15 years in China's supply chain management, moving to Canada in 2017 presented unexpected challenges. Lacking local experience and education, I felt helpless and struggled to restart my career. Through determination and reeducation, I've worked as an Import & Export Specialist in Canada for over 4 years, earning CPIM and CSCP certifications, and transitioning to a supply planning role.",
      "<strong>This personal journey highlighted the struggles that many new immigrants face despite their excellent backgrounds.</strong> They possess valuable skills and experience that could greatly benefit local companies, but often lack the support to navigate the Canadian industry. This realization inspired me to co-found this organization, aiming to empower those facing similar struggles by providing support on career paths, reeducation, networking, skill learning, and experience sharing. I want to help them find a better life in Canada, just as I did."
